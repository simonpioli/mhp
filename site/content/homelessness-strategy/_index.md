    The Manchester Homelessness strategy was co-produced by members of MHP
    including people with personal insight into homelessness, people who work
    for the council and frontline services.


    Each sector has been asked to respond with an action plan to meet this
    strategy, including the council, health, housing, voluntary sector and
    businesses.
